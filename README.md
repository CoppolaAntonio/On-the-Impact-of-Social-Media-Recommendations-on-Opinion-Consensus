# On-the-Impact-of-Social-Media-Recommendations-on-Opinion-Consensus

This repository collects all the experimental results obtained for the paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.03299. 

In the Sync_Update directory we collected all the results related to the section "General Networks" of the paper. The name of the folders are equal to the name of the Figures in the chapter described above, e.g., in Figure 2 we collected all the experimental results obtained in the setting described for the Figure 2 in the paper.

In the Async_Update directory, we collected all the results related to the section "Impact on Consensus" of the paper. In this case, the name of the foldershe figures in the chapeter "Impact on Consensus", but they are  equal to the name of the folders in the Sync_Update directory. Specifically, in the folder Aysnc_Update/Figure 2 we collected the results obtained in the same setting of Sync_Update/Figure 2 but with asynchronous dynamics. We did that for making easier the comparison between the results obtained with the two differenct dynamics, asynchronous and synchronous.
